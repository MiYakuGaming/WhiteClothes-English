**Story**  
The protagonist, Milne, was brainwashed by her older sister and had her younger sibling kidnapped.  
She embarks on an adventure to defeat the Demon King.  
Characters with unique personalities engage in lively dialogue—whether during story events or combat!  
The tone is light-hearted with a touch of dark humor; it’s not overly serious.  

**Combat**  
Fight sequences are dynamic, fast-paced, and filled with flashy effects.  
Enemies aren’t pushovers—especially the weaker ones vanish before you can land a hit.  
For boss battles, ensure your team has proper gear and skill synergy.  
It might feel overwhelming at first glance, but there’s always a solution.  

**Dungeons**  
Checkpoints are strategically placed so progress isn't lost.  
Once past certain points, earlier sections become optional challenges.  
If wiped out, you retain experience and enemy drops—only items from chests are lost.  
Collect scattered "Star Candies" to enhance passive abilities.  
You can tweak your party's formation as needed; weaker characters should stay in the back-line.  

**First Version Details**  
This initial release lets players progress halfway through the story. Character levels cap at 50, and game-play clocks in around 30–40 hours.  
Remaining content will be released via updates.  

# **Translation**
WhiteClothes is created and developed by MokomuGame, and the developer is aware and supportive of this Translation.  
This is an Uncensored Translation Hack of WhiteClothes and is currently being Translated by 未訳・MiYaku Gaming.  
If you want more information about the Translation, feel free to look at the contents of this GitHub page, it will be updated with Commits as I make Translation updates.  

# **Installing the Translation on Steam**
In order to play this game on Steam, you need to install the only Japanese release on Steam and XUnity Auto Translator and a Loader of your choice directly in the Game's installation folder.  
This project uses MelonLoader 0.5.7 because it's the only version that works on Windows, but you can use whatever works for you.  
https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator  
WhiteClothes is only available on Windows and supports Linux via Proton experimental from my testing without Translation normally but the Translation hack does not work in Linux at all.  
I use Linux Mint Cinnamon primarily for editing the main Translation file and testing in Windows, but currently, Games built with IL2CPP are not supported on Linux nor will it work.  
When there is an update that allows IL2CPP to work on Linux, I will detail that in the future.  

# **Future Plans**
Fine-tune text formatting and adjust font settings for English.  
Begin using Stable Diffusion and possibly Gimp or something else to Translate images to maintain the original look and feel of the artistic intent, textures and icons where necessary.  

# **Warning**
This Translation is in the early stages and will take considerable time to be completed, and to account for updates by MokomuGame, the developer of WhiteClothes.  
The Translation is not meant for a younger or sensitive gamer, WhiteClothes was developed with an older audience in mind and features mature themes and sexual imagery, so if you are easily offended or too young, please find something else to play.  

# **Supporting Translation Efforts**
Thanks to your generosity and support, I have received some Donations, so if you are satisfied with my Translations and my work, consider Donating here:

# **AI Disclosure**
I use a Locally Installed Japanese AI to assist me with English writing because I am a terrible writer, but I ensure every line matches the original without sacrifice and remains 1:1 with the developer's original idea and intent.
